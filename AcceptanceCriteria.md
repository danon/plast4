## Acceptance Criteria

### Projects

#### Create project with name and optional dates
- **When** the user creates a project named "Tower A" with a start and end date
- **Then** a project named "Tower A" exists in the system with a start and end date

- **When** the user creates a project named "Tower B" without start and end dates
- **Then** a project named "Tower B" exists in the system with no start or end date

#### Add project fragments
- **Given** a project named "Tower A" exists
- **When** the user adds a fragment from 2025-07-01 to 2025-07-10
- **Then** the fragment is listed for "Tower A" with the specified dates

#### Calculate project progress
- **Given** a project with start date 2025-07-01 and end date 2025-07-31 exists
- **And** the current date is 2025-07-11
- **When** the user requests the project progress
- **Then** the progress is calculated as 10 / 30 = 33.33%

- **Given** a project with start date 2025-07-01 and no end date exists
- **When** the user requests the project progress
- **Then** no progress is returned

- **When** a worker has no assignments during that range
- **Then** their status is **Unassigned**

##### Underbooked
- **Given** a planning from 2025-07-14 to 2025-07-18 exists
- **When** a worker is assigned on 2 days
- **Then** their status is **Underbooked**

##### Fully booked

#### Extend planning to weekend
- **Given** a planning covers 2025-07-14 to 2025-07-18
